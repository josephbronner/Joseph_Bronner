    "The RAND Database of Worldwide Terrorism Incidents (RDWTI) is a compilation of data from 1968 through 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "This legacy RAND project developed and maintained a database of terrorism incidents stretching back to 1968, which provides comprehensive information on international and domestic terrorism. Over the years, many public and private sponsors have contributed to the maintenance of the RDWTI and its predecessors, the RAND Terrorism Chronology and the RAND-MIPT Terrorism Incident Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be found here: https://www.rand.org/nsrd/projects/terrorism-incidents.html\n",
    "\n",
    "With over 40,000 incidents of terrorism coded and detailed, the quality and completeness of the RDWTI was remarkable for its time. RAND staff conducted extensive research on candidate terrorist attacks, drawing on staff with regional expertise, relevant language skills, and in-country field work experience."

You could use research or domain knowledge into perpetrators and their stated goals. You will have to resolve or define new categories.
